          <h2>Facts About Clouds</h2>

          <p>
            Clouds are like nature‚Äôs art canvas! üé® They come in all shapes and
            sizes, and no two clouds are ever exactly the same. Did you know
            that clouds are made of tiny water droplets or ice crystals? When
            light hits them just right, they can create the most amazing colors
            during sunrise or sunset! üåÖ Some clouds even have names, like
            cumulus (fluffy and puffy) and cirrus (thin and wispy). They can
            tell us a lot about the weather, too! It‚Äôs pretty magical how they
            float in the sky, constantly shifting and changing. üå§Ô∏è

            Clouds are incredibly fascinating and play a crucial role in the
            Earth's atmosphere. They form when warm air rises, cools, and the
            moisture in the air condenses into tiny water droplets or ice
            crystals. The process starts when warm, moist air rises, cools, and
            then the water vapor in the air turns into liquid droplets or solid
            ice crystals, forming clouds. These clouds can be categorized into
            different types based on their appearance and height. Cumulus clouds
            are the fluffy, cotton-ball types that often look like animals or
            other objects. Stratus clouds, on the other hand, are low and flat,
            often covering the sky like a giant blanket. Cirrus clouds are high
            and wispy, made up of ice crystals, and often signal a change in
            weather. Nimbus clouds are the ones that bring rain, while
            altostratus and altocumulus clouds are found at mid-level and often
            signal changing weather patterns. Clouds can vary in height as well,
            with high-level clouds like cirrus being above 20,000 feet, while
            low-level clouds like stratus are closer to the Earth's surface. Not
            all clouds bring rain, but certain ones like nimbostratus and
            cumulonimbus clouds are responsible for storms and heavy rainfall.
            Beyond their beauty and variety, clouds also regulate Earth's
            temperature. During the day, they reflect sunlight and help cool the
            planet, while at night, they act like a blanket, trapping heat and
            preventing rapid cooling. Interestingly, scientists study clouds to
            understand climate change, as shifts in cloud formation can impact
            weather patterns and global temperatures. These fluffy formations
            are not just pretty to look at but are also vital to Earth's weather
            systems and climate!
